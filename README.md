# Sensorial Effects Video

## NCL application 
------------------
![](http://www.ncl.org.br/sites/ncl.org.br/files/newsflash_logo.png)

The NCL application that presents a video using atuators to enable sensorial
effects.  
The NCL application was developed using the NCL Composer.  
The atuators service was development using Intel XDK and Intel Galileo with
three atuators: air flor; smell spray; and a lamp.  
The configuration process are described in the a
[instructable website](https://www.instructables.com/id/Sensorial-Galileo-for-Video-based-Applications-Usi)
An paper was published in [WSOT workshop at WebMedia 2016](http://www.lbd.dcc.ufmg.br/colecoes/wsotwebmedia/2016/003.pdf).
